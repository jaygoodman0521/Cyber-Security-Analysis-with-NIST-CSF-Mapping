This folder contains the artifacts that tie every NIST CSF subcategory to current/target maturity, priority, mitigations, and cost rationale.


**Files**

Qualicart NIST Matrix.pdf — Master matrix of NIST CSF subcategories (ID/PR/DE/RS/RC) with current maturity, target maturity, priority level, and recommended mitigation strategy. Use this as the source of truth when creating work items or tracking maturity deltas. 

Qualicart NIST Matrix

Cost Implementation Road Map.pdf — Three-year, quarter-by-quarter cost plan mapping each subcategory to estimated implementation cost and a comparative estimated damage (breach) cost to support ROI and sequencing decisions. 

Cost Implementation Road Map

Statistical Visual.png — Box-plot comparing the distribution of Implementation Costs vs Damage Costs to visualize why prevention is favored (lower median/variance for implementation vs potential damage).


**How to use**

Start with the Matrix to pick high-priority, high-impact subcategories; note target levels and mitigations. 

Qualicart NIST Matrix

Cross-reference the Road Map to slot chosen controls into the correct year/quarter and validate budget vs breach-risk tradeoffs. 

Cost Implementation Road Map

Use the Statistical Visual in exec briefings to communicate cost dynamics at a glance.


**Outputs to expect**

Sprint/epic tickets derived from matrix rows

Quarterly budgets aligned to the road map

KPI tracking against target maturity per function (ID/PR/DE/RS/RC)


**Update guidance**

When a control ships, update its current maturity and re-export the matrix; then re-baseline costs in the road map for the next planning cycle.

Source matrices and cost schedules are compiled from the attached PDFs; the visualization summarizes their cost distributions.
